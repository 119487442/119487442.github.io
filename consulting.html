	<h1> Hyperautomation </h2>
	<h3><br>This deals with the application of advanced technologies, to increasingly automate processes
	<br>and augment humans. Hyperautomation brings together several components of process automation, 
	<br>integrating tools and technologies that amplify the ability to automate work. It starts with 
	<br>robotic process automation (RPA) at its core, and expands automation capability with artificial
	<br>intelligence (AI), process mining, analytics, and other advanced tools. The idea is to automate
	<br>more and more knowledge work, and engage everyone in an organization to be part of the transformation.</h3>

	<h1> Multiexperience </h1>
	<h3><br>A multi-experience development platform is adevelopment platform that is used for developing not just
	<br>mobile and web applications, but also chat, voice, augmented reality and wearable experiences. Multiexperience
	<br>is a concept pioneered by Gartner late in 2019. The concept is being championed as one of the biggest developments 
	<br>for 2020. In fact, Gartner states that “more than 25% of the mobile apps, progressive web apps and conversational
	<br>apps at large enterprises will be built and/or run through a multiexperience development platform” by 2023.
   <br> In short, multiexperience is about adapting to the increasing market of different devices and their respective 
	<br>experiences. Applications now need to run on different platforms and adapt easily, all while providing
	<br>a consistent experience from a business perspective. Why is this relevant? For one, it’s because a few companies
	<br>are already doing it and, for another, it’s because the average individual currently owns 3.2 different devices.
	<br>In other words, it’s becoming the increasingly expected norm.</h3>
