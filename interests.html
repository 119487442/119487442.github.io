<h2>Football</h2>

Football is my favourite sport. Ive been playing since i was 5 years old. 
<br>
<br>I started playing football for Freebooters at the age of five. From the ages of u12-u16 We won a number of titles. 
<br>We won the cup three times and won the league four times. I would usually play upfront or on the wing.
<br>My skills would be my pace and my fast turning. I had a great touch and was a great playmaker.
<br>I was Playing with a team for that long shows i have great teamwork skills and my mindset is always consistent as we won consecutive league titles. 
<br>
<br>In 2017 I got injured in a match which ruled me out for nearly a year. I recovered from my injurey and had a great pre season with freebooters
<br>and after not so long my got injured again which ruled me out for another year.
<br>
<br>I then joined my local football club Castlewarren Celtic who i currently play for. I joined them 3 years ago
<br>and since then we came runners up in the cup and league in 2018. I got top goal scorer in 2017.
<br>
<br>I also joined the UCC 5 a side football team. I am part of the committee and next year i will be running the club along with my teammates.
